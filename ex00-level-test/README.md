# Java Measurement and Calculation Application

This Java application provides functionalities for measuring distances between two points in a Cartesian plane and calculating the area and perimeter of different shapes.

## The Exercise

The challenge for this project was to create a versatile Java application capable of tackling two primary tasks:

1. **Distance Measurement:**
    - Implement a feature that allows users to measure the distance between two points in a Cartesian plane. The application should take input coordinates for each point and provide the accurate distance.

2. **Shape Calculation:**
    - Develop functionality to calculate both the area and perimeter of various shapes. Users should have the option to choose different shapes and input the necessary parameters for the calculations.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile and run the `Main` class.

## How to Use

1. Run the application.
2. Choose the relevant option:
    - Option 0: Measure the distance between two points.
    - Option 1: Calculate area and perimeter of different shapes.
    - Option 2: Exit the application.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions for each selected option to input coordinates or shape parameters.
