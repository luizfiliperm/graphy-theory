# Graph Fundamentals

This is a Graph Fundamentals exercise repository! This project is an exploration of diverse challenges that span the realms of graph theory and project management. We've structured our repository to provide solutions and insights for two distinct hackathons, each offering unique problem statements and opportunities for learning.

## HACKATHON 01

### Overview

This exercise contains solutions for the challenges presented in HACKATHON 01 below. The challenges revolve around graph theory and analysis, covering topics such as vertex lists, edge lists, graph properties, and real-world applications.

### The challenge

Consider the following graph and indicate what is requested

IMAGE

1. Vertex List

2. Edge List

3. How many loops are there?

4. Is the graph directed?

5. What is the degree of each vertex?

6. Is there any pending vertex?

7. Is there any isolated vertex?

8. List the neighbors of each vertex

9. List the neighbors of each edge

10. Is this a multigraph?

11. Express the degree sequence of the graph

12. Describe a real-world situation that can be explained/described by the graph


## HACKATHON 02

### Overview

This section addresses a different challenge related to project management and scheduling. 

The goal is to construct a graph representing the tasks and dependencies involved in building a treehouse.

### Problem Statement

Consider the following table outlining the steps to construct a treehouse:

|                    Tasks                    | Prerequisites | Days |
|:-------------------------------------------:|:-------------:|:----:|
| 1 - Clearing terrain                        |      None     |   4  |
| 2 - Production and laying of the foundation |       1       |   3  |
| 3 - Structure production                    |       2       |   7  |
| 4 - Roof placement                          |       3       |   6  |
| 5 - Placing the external boards             |       3       |   4  |
| 6 - Plumbing and wiring installation        |    4 and 5    |   6  |
| 7 - Placement of windows and doors          |       3       |   5  |
| 8 - Installation of windows and doors       |       6       |   5  |
| 9 - Interior Painting                       |    7 and 8    |   5  |

Build a graph based on the table, where each task is a vertex and transitions between tasks represent edges. 

Determine the minimum and maximum time required to construct the treehouse.

Consider the graph you generated and indicate what is required:

1. List of Vertices
2. List of Edges
3. How many loops are there?
4. Is the graph directed?
5. What is the degree of each vertex?
6. Is there any pendant vertex?
7. Is there any isolated vertex?
8. List the neighbors of each vertex
9. List the neighbors of each edge
10. Is this a multigraph?
11. Express the degree sequence of the graph
